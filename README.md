# Welcome to the Humpback Hackers' Tactical Tiles!

The game can be run with `dune exec bin/main.exe`.
-Add the program argument `skip` to hide the intro text and instructions if you do not need to see them again.
-Add the program argument `modeN` where N is the mode number you want, as a shortcut past mode choice.
-Add the program argument `sizeS` where S is the size you want, as a shortcut past size choice.
-Add the program argument `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` to immediately choose that difficulty and bypass the choice.
